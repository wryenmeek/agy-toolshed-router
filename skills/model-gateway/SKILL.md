# model-gateway

Local processes give Claude Code native access to the user's subscription and CLI models (ChatGPT/Codex, Grok, and Antigravity Gemini and Claude models):
`claude-code-proxy` (translates Anthropic Messages API to the Codex backend), Grok CLI backend, and Antigravity (`agy`) CLI backend.
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at the shim router: requests for `claude-gpt-*` go to Codex, `claude-grok-*` to Grok, and `claude-agy-*` / `claude-gemini-*`
to Antigravity Gemini and Claude models, while everything else passes through to api.anthropic.com with the user's normal claude.ai login.
The shim's `/v1/models` advertises gateway models with a `claude-` prefix because Claude Code's model discovery drops ids that don't
start with `claude`/`anthropic`. The route is decided by the backend family segment (`claude-gpt-*`, `claude-grok-*`, `claude-agy-*`), never by the prefix alone.

All commands: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/model-gateway.js" <command>`

## First-time setup

Project-local wiring is the standard setup. `env --write-project` writes the current project's `.claude/settings.local.json`, so the gateway stays configured for this project's sessions and executor worktrees without putting a machine-local endpoint in a committed file. `setup` uses the same project-local target by default.

`env --write-user` remains an opt-in shared fallback for people who deliberately want one gateway URL in `~/.claude/settings.json` across every project. Claude Code gives a current project's `settings.local.json` higher precedence, so `doctor` marks the winner `[effective]`, names both files, and says that project-local wiring wins when their gateway modes disagree.

The first-run order matters:

1. Install Model Gateway at the recommended project scope.
2. Reload plugins so the new skill is available.
3. Invoke this skill and run `setup` (the automated onboarding wizard audits prerequisites, prompts for configuration scope, and wires the gateway).
4. If setup says sign-in is needed, have the user complete `login`, then run `setup` again. The second setup finishes the download, wiring, and project confirmation.
5. After the project wiring is confirmed, tell the user to fully restart the Claude Code process for this same project before selecting a model.

A plugin reload alone does not reload settings or the picker cache. Do not tell the user to select a new row until that full restart is complete.

The SessionStart hook injects a one-line nudge while the gateway is in any half-configured
state; act on it. The user sees that same line in the transcript, because a state only they can fix used to
reach the model alone. Anything routine stays out of it, and the hook always exits 0 so the line survives:
run `ensure` yourself when you need an exit code. SessionStart waits at most 12 seconds for a newly started
supervisor, then leaves it to finish in the background so it stays inside Claude Code's hook budget.

`setup` is an automated onboarding wizard:
- Runs pre-flight prerequisite and dependency checks (`Node.js`, `AGY` CLI/model access, `claude-code-proxy`, `Grok`, ports, and shadowed env variables).
- In interactive terminal sessions, prompts the user to choose between project-local scope (`.claude/settings.local.json`) [Recommended] and user-global scope (`~/.claude/settings.json`). Supports non-interactive CLI flags: `--scope project|user`, `--interactive`, and `--yes`.
- Downloads and verifies the proxy binary, starts all gateway processes, updates model discovery cache, and outputs clear next steps.

```bash
# Automated onboarding wizard (interactive prompt in TTY, or pass explicit scope)
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/model-gateway.js" setup
# or explicitly choose scope non-interactively:
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/model-gateway.js" setup --scope project --yes

# only if setup says ChatGPT sign-in is needed:
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/model-gateway.js" login    # browser OAuth; --device for headless
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/model-gateway.js" setup    # finishes the wiring
```

`login` opens the user's browser; they complete it themselves (suggest `! node ... login` if it
needs a real TTY). `env --write-project` writes this project's `.claude/settings.local.json`.
Use `env --write-user` only when the user wants a shared fallback across projects. If both are
present, project-local wiring wins: `doctor` marks it `[effective]`, names the shadowed user file,
and fails when their gateway modes differ. All wiring changes apply to new Claude Code sessions,
so restart after the write. The Codex rows appear in `/model` labeled "From gateway".

The winning `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` source follows Claude Code's precedence: process environment,
current-project `.claude/settings.local.json`, project `.claude/settings.json`, then user
`~/.claude/settings.json`. A process export always wins, so settings writes cannot replace it.

When `doctor` or SessionStart says that process env shadows a wired settings file, Model Gateway is
bypassed. If the user controls the Claude Code CLI launch, they can correct or unset
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, then restart. If the host replaces that value, use the supported Claude Code CLI
on the wired project instead. Model Gateway does not support Desktop routing under forced overrides on
Windows or macOS, and settings, parent, or User-scope edits cannot be promised to win.

`env --write-user --reconcile` is confirmation-gated. Plain `env --write-user` writes the shared
user fallback, then lists recorded projects whose local URL differs without changing their files.
The confirmed command removes only Model Gateway-owned keys from those other projects'
`.claude/settings.local.json` files: its base URL, the three Claude alias pins, and static gateway
flags whose values equal plugin defaults. It leaves unrelated settings alone, skips projects already
agreeing, cannot change `process.env`, and needs a restart to affect a new session.
Discovery needs Claude Code v2.1.129+; `models` shows exactly what the shim advertises. Claude Code
only refetches gateway discovery when it has an API-key credential. OAuth subscriptions do not give it
one, so Model Gateway writes Claude Code's discovery cache whenever its advertised list changes.

Restart remains necessary to surface new rows in `/model`: Claude Code reads the picker cache once at
session start. `/reload-plugins` does not reload it. Restoring or refreshing auth on an already-wired
install needs no restart of the current Claude Code process: the proxy is a separate process, so once `login` + `setup` re-authenticate it,
the next request routes through cleanly. Settings, discovery-cache, plugin, or model-row changes do need a full restart of the affected project process. Keep these two recovery paths separate. The shim supervisor also probes the proxy's `/v1/models` endpoint
while it runs, confirming a failed probe through a fresh connection before restarting an unavailable proxy with single-flight bounded backoff. It leaves a healthy proxy
alone. Recovery output remains in `~/.claude/model-gateway/logs/guardian.log`; bounded lifecycle records in
`~/.claude/model-gateway/logs/lifecycle.jsonl` identify supervisor, worker, and proxy PIDs, orderly
stop/restart requests, observed exits, and recovery outcomes. Use `doctor` to print the evidence path and
the last observed exit. An OS termination or force-killed supervisor may leave no final record, so treat an
absent exit record as absence of evidence, not a clean shutdown. Cleanup kills recorded PIDs only when the
live command still identifies this install and the record matches its command or start time. A stale record is
deleted without stopping its reused PID; `doctor` prints `stale pid
file guardian: PID <pid> is now <command>`. Proxy recovery stops a listener using the shared proxy binary only
when the live process tree proves it descends from the recovering supervisor. A matching shared binary alone
never proves ownership. A failed `/v1/models` check gets one fresh-connection confirmation before recovery can stop an owned listener; a healthy confirmation resets recovery without stopping or starting the proxy. This matters when an agent is mid-orchestration
(e.g. dispatching Codex subagents through the gateway): do not tell the user to restart Claude Code just to
bring auth back, or you kill the session that was about to use it.

## Selecting models

- AGY discovery invokes `agy models` at worker startup and accepts valid `gemini-*`, `gpt-oss-*`, and `claude-*` ids. Fallback order is dynamic CLI output, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache/models_cache.json`, then built-in defaults. The timeout is 10 seconds by default (`CODEX_GATEWAY_AGY_MODELS_TIMEOUT_MS`); `CODEX_GATEWAY_AGY_HOME` selects another AGY home. Dynamic rows update the gateway discovery cache and require a new Claude Code process; `/reload-plugins` does not reload picker rows. Auth refresh from successful `login`/`setup` normally needs no restart unless settings, discovery cache, plugin files, or model rows changed. AGY Claude quota rows are exposed as `claude-agy-claude-<model>[1m]`, with the namespace and suffix removed before forwarding. AGY Claude needs an installed/authenticated `agy` CLI; `GEMINI_API_KEY` supports AGY Gemini/API models but not Claude quota models. CLI request failures are errors, not empty successes. CLI requests retain a one-hour default wall-clock timeout (`CODEX_GATEWAY_AGY_TIMEOUT_MS`, capped at one hour); timed-out children receive SIGTERM then bounded SIGKILL escalation and return HTTP 504. Discovery is capped at 256 KiB by default (`CODEX_GATEWAY_AGY_DISCOVERY_OUTPUT_LIMIT`, capped at 1 MiB). AGY executable lookup is canonicalized and rejects non-regular, non-executable, or group/world-writable Unix files; only supported auth/config environment variables are passed to children.
- Typed: `/model claude-gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`, `/model claude-grok-4.5[1m]`, `/model claude-agy-gemini-3.6-flash[1m]`, or `/model claude-agy-gemini-3.1-pro[1m]`. The picker and Sidequest catalog emit those exact ids. The prefix/suffix is translated before routing upstream.
- `lib/runtime.js`'s exported `MODEL_WINDOW_POLICY` is the sole authority for gateway backend windows, picker aliases, advertised windows, and sentry mode. GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, Luna, and GPT-6 Astra are measured rows. GPT ids absent from the table are deliberately advertised through its explicitly unmeasured 920k default, rather than silently inheriting a window. Grok 4.5 is a measured 500k row with the `[1m]` picker alias. Gemini 3.6 Flash and 3.1 Pro have 1M context windows with the `[1m]` picker alias, and dynamic new AGY models automatically resolve via `agy-default`.
- Codex GPT-5.6 through the ChatGPT Codex product (the subscription login this gateway routes to, not the pay-per-token API) accepted 920,012 input tokens and refused 935,012 on 2026-09-05 through claude-code-proxy 0.1.35 (upstream 55bf0b58). The shim advertises `920000` by default. Its synthetic 413 trigger is the smaller of `CODEX_GATEWAY_COMPACT_TRIGGER` when set and the policy row's backend window minus 40k tokens. `CODEX_GATEWAY_COMPACT_TRIGGER` is a ceiling, never an override of that headroom. With the optional client `autoCompactWindow` cap at `325000`, Claude Code compacts around `292000`, so the sentry is a backstop that normally does not fire. `CODEX_GATEWAY_CONTEXT_WINDOW` overrides every advertised Codex window. Claude Code 2.1.261 ignores a settings-file `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` value for its own unrecognized-model resolver, so rows above 200k use their policy's recognized `[1m]` alias. That alias gives Claude Code a 1M client window, the closest available setting to the verified 920k backend window; it does not promise a 1M backend input limit. A lower explicit `autoCompactWindow` still wins. Use `/context` to inspect the selected model and effective cap.
- Claude models (opus/sonnet/fable, with or without `[1m]`) keep their OWN separate native windows
  and compaction limits: the shim forwards their requests byte-identically to Anthropic and never
  applies Codex window advertisement or error rewriting to them. The env block pins the current
  real 1M aliases (Opus, Sonnet, Fable) to `[1m]` ids so a gateway session on one gets its full 1M
  window instead of the 200k gateway default; Haiku stays unpinned (it's 200k). An `env --write-*`
  command resolves those aliases through the installed Claude CLI's credential-free headless probe;
  SessionStart refreshes its cache after the CLI changes or the cache ages out. A failed probe keeps
  the last good pin, then a shipped safe default. Set a persistent per-alias override with
  `pin --opus claude-opus-4-8[1m]` (same for `--sonnet` and `--fable`), or use `pin --opus default`
  to return to auto-detection. Overrides always win. `pin` with no arguments shows each effective
  pin and whether it is overridden. Overrides live in `~/.claude/model-gateway/pins.json`, outside
  the plugin cache. After a pin change or Claude CLI upgrade, run `env --write-project` (or
  `env --write-user` for a shared fallback) and start a new Claude Code session; changing a saved value alone cannot alter
  an open session.
- Do NOT set a
  global `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`: it applies to both providers and can make Codex
  `/compact` fail after history already exceeds the Codex limit.
- Caution: loading a huge reference skill (e.g. `claude-api`, ~800k chars) in a single turn can
  spike Codex context past the point proactive compaction can recover from. Prefer pulling large
  references incrementally on Codex models.
- The advertised catalog is a built-in list (proxy v0.1.10 serves no /v1/models). A `models.json` file cannot add a backend that the claude-code-proxy allowlist does not support; update the proxy through `setup` instead.
- **RC-compat and missing Codex rows**: Remote Control and the Codex/Grok rows in `/model` cannot
  both work. RC-compatibility points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at `api.anthropic.com`, and Claude Code
  disables gateway model discovery for that host. The gateway still routes explicit ids: type
  `/model claude-gpt-5.6-terra[1m]`, and Claude Code accepts and saves it as the default. Disabling
  compatibility restores the picker rows. Sidequest dispatch is unaffected because it resolves its
  explicit route marker and never uses picker discovery.
- Claude models keep working normally at the same time (passthrough path); subagents can mix tiers
  freely.
- **Codex schema compatibility**: Codex rejects some Unicode property escapes such as `\p{Cc}` and `\P{Cf}`. After deferred hydration, the shim changes only a Codex-bound provider hint, never Claude Code's host schema or an Anthropic request. It admits a missing dialect or Draft 2020-12 and only `pattern` instances reached through `properties`, compatible `patternProperties` values, `additionalProperties`, `items`, `prefixItems`, `allOf`, `anyOf`, `dependentSchemas`, `propertyNames`, or `unevaluatedProperties`/`unevaluatedItems`. Each real property atom must stand alone in a negated character class without ranges, set syntax, captures, backreferences, or a negative regex context. The shim removes only that atom and preserves every other regex byte. `not`, conditionals, `oneOf`, `contains`, references, definitions, content schemas, affected pattern-property keys, unknown containers, and unsafe regexes refuse locally with HTTP 400 naming the tool, JSON Pointer, and reason code. Tell the user it was not forwarded or rerouted. Do not claim arbitrary schemas are preserved or try to bypass that diagnostic.

## Local gateway records

Request-route logging is enabled by default. It writes metadata-only JSONL records to
`~/.claude/model-gateway/logs/request-routes.jsonl`: timestamp, backend, model, request path, route and
effort when present, safe session and agent correlation ids, and dispatch-marker length when present. It
never writes request bodies, prompts, messages, tools, authentication, or arbitrary headers. Honor a user
request to disable it by setting `CODEX_GATEWAY_REQUEST_LOG=0` before the shim starts, then restart the shim
through `setup` or `ensure`. The value is read when the shim process starts, so `/reload-plugins` does not
change an already-running shim. `CODEX_GATEWAY_REQUEST_LOG_PATH` changes the file location.

Usage observability also writes one high-water JSON file per valid session under
`~/.claude/model-gateway/request-body/`. The filename is derived from the session id. Its contents are the
largest forwarded request-body byte count observed for that session and an observation timestamp. It does
not contain the request body. No retention period is promised for either local record.

For the confirmation-gated procedure, use the `remote-control-compatibility` skill. It manages the
plugin-marked hosts block, creates a backup before an elevated write, reconciles gateway mode, and
checks the final state. Do not edit the hosts file outside that procedure. If effective process env
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is HTTPS `api.anthropic.com` (including port 443), enabling is refused before any
backup, hosts write, startup, or reconciliation because the loopback mapping cannot serve TLS. A
user-controlled Claude Code CLI launch can correct or unset that value, then restart. If a host replaces
it, use the supported Claude Code CLI on the wired project instead. Desktop routing is unsupported under
forced overrides on Windows and macOS, and settings, parent, or User-scope edits cannot be promised to
win. Disabling stays available.

Claude Code's `/remote-control` only lights up when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is exactly the real
Anthropic host, which conflicts with gateway model discovery. Remote Control and the Codex/Grok rows
in `/model` cannot both work. Before enabling compatibility, tell the user that the rows disappear
from the picker, while explicit ids such as `/model claude-gpt-5.6-terra` still work and persist as
the default. Disabling compatibility restores the rows. model-gateway offers an opt-in, fully
reversible workaround:

- The user (never this plugin, never automatically) adds one hosts entry mapping
  `api.anthropic.com` to loopback — `127.0.0.1 api.anthropic.com` on Windows
  (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`, needs Administrator), macOS, and Linux (`/etc/hosts`,
  needs `sudo`). If asked to help with this, tell the user the exact line and file, and that they
  need elevated privileges to save it; do not attempt to edit the hosts file yourself.
- `ensure`/`setup`/`doctor` detect the entry (read-only) and, only after confirming the shim can
  actually bind loopback port 80, switch `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to `http://api.anthropic.com` and
  start a second listener on port 80 next to the usual `127.0.0.1:18764`. Exactly one line tells
  the user to restart Claude Code when the mode changes either direction.
- Removing the hosts entry, or port 80 becoming unavailable (no permission, or something else is
  using it), reverts to default mode automatically, again with one restart line.
- `doctor` reports the hosts entry (if any), whether port 80 actually bound (and why not if it
  didn't), and which mode each settings scope (user/project) is wired to.
- Test/advanced overrides: `CODEX_GATEWAY_HOSTS_FILE` (custom hosts path), `CODEX_GATEWAY_COMPAT_PORT`
  (port other than 80). Neither is needed for normal use.

## Day-2 operations

```bash
... status      # what's running
... doctor      # binary, auth, ports, model count, settings wiring
... ensure      # start whatever is down (SessionStart hook runs this with --quiet)
... stop
... env --remove   # unwire Claude Code (do this BEFORE uninstalling the plugin)
```

`doctor` prints the full model-window table: backend and picker ids, backend and advertised windows,
Claude Code's resolved client window and compaction point, sentry mode and trigger, and the measurement
date. It includes Codex, Grok, and native Claude pin rows. Its model-id check is useful for stale shim ids,
but a `PASS` does not prove every supported model is present. A proxy from 0.1.14 through 0.1.35 can
omit GPT-6 Astra while this check passes. If Astra is missing, check the installed and serving proxy
version, rerun `setup` to fetch the latest release, and fully restart Claude Code. Astra requires
claude-code-proxy 0.1.36 or newer. A `models.json` edit cannot add a backend that the proxy allowlist
does not support. A `FAIL` naming missing and extra ids means the shim is stale even when its version
matches: restart it through the normal `ensure` or `setup` path, then restart Claude Code sessions so the
picker re-discovers the rows.

Logs live in `~/.claude/model-gateway/logs/`. `guardian.log` has recovery output; `lifecycle.jsonl`
has bounded process evidence that `doctor` summarizes. Ports: shim 18764, proxy 18765 (override with
`CODEX_GATEWAY_PORT` / `CODEX_GATEWAY_PROXY_PORT`, but the env block and running processes must
agree).

## Failure modes worth knowing

- **Every request fails after wiring**: a SessionStart hook can time out while it starts the shim. Claude Code cancels that hook, and a directly spawned supervisor can die with its process tree before it records an exit. Model Gateway launches the supervisor outside that tree and stops waiting before the hook budget, but if this is an older install or it still repeats, run
  `doctor`, check logs. Worst case `env --remove` restores stock behavior instantly.
- **Codex sessions drop while this plugin's suite runs**: this version scopes fixture cleanup to
  the test gateway home, so the suite never touches the installed gateway. If it happens after
  updating, run `doctor` and include its supervisor conflict line and lifecycle evidence.
- **Codex models error, Claude models fine**: proxy or OpenAI side. Check `login` state
  (`doctor` shows auth), then proxy log. OpenAI gates non-Codex clients by request fingerprint;
  when they tighten it, requests die mid-stream until claude-code-proxy ships a fix, so
  suggest re-running `setup` (it fetches the latest release).
- **Startup, recovery, restart, or drain refuses to touch a listener**: each ownership probe is bounded by
  `CODEX_GATEWAY_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` (2 seconds by default). A timeout, malformed process result, or
  unrecognized command leaves ownership unknown. Startup records `owner-unknown` and leaves that
  listener untouched; recovery leaves it for the next tick. A confirmed foreign owner gets the same
  refusal. Probe children are stopped with the supervisor, so they cannot keep a test fixture home open.
- **`doctor` shows `Not authenticated` right after an upgrade**: bumping the proxy binary (e.g.
  0.1.10 → 0.1.17 via `setup`) can invalidate the credential the old version accepted — the new
  binary reads it as not authenticated and `setup` stops before wiring. Fix: re-run `login`, then
  `setup` again to finish. Until then every Codex model is down, so any run that routes to
  Codex (a whole sidequest board of Codex-tier tickets, for one) stalls entirely.
- **GPT-6 Astra is missing from `/model`**: do not diagnose account access first. Check the installed and serving claude-code-proxy version. Astra requires 0.1.36 or newer; 0.1.35 does not include its backend allowlist, while the current doctor floor can still pass. Re-run `setup` to fetch the latest GitHub release, then fully restart Claude Code. Do not propose `models.json`: it cannot add a backend the proxy does not allow.
- **No "From gateway" rows in /model**: discovery is off (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`
  missing), Claude Code < v2.1.129, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` is set (it
  disables discovery), or RC-compatibility is active. Claude Code only refetches discovery with an
  API-key credential, so OAuth users rely on Model Gateway's cache write. Run `doctor` to check the
  cache, then restart Claude Code after it updates; `/reload-plugins` does not reload picker rows.
- **Thinking/reasoning**: the Codex backend doesn't return thinking blocks into Claude Code's
  UI; that's an upstream limitation, not a bug here.
- **Permission mode flips to "accept edits on" during Codex sessions**: caused by GPT models
  calling the plan-mode tools; an approved ExitPlanMode downgrades the mode instead of
  restoring it (anthropics/claude-code#39973). The shim strips EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode from
  Codex-bound requests since 0.2.1, so this shouldn't recur; if it does, make sure the shim was
  restarted (`stop` + `start`). Shift+Tab restores the mode in an affected session. Escape
  hatch to re-enable plan tools: `CODEX_GATEWAY_KEEP_PLAN_TOOLS=1`.
